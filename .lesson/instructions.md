# Instructions  

The purpose of this exercise is to build quicksort and binary search algorithms.

# Input

The user will first input a number (N), indicating how many numbers will follow.

Then the user will input N integers on the same line, separated by spaces.

Finally, the user will provide a single integer (M).

```
4
1 5 4 3
1
```

# Output

Your job is to read the list of integers from the user, sort the list using a quicksort() algorithm, print the sorted list, read the integer M, and print the index of the integer M in the sorted list.

If M is not found in the list, print -1.
